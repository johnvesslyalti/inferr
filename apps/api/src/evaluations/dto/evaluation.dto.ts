/**
 * DTOs for the AI Evaluations module.
 *
 * An EvaluationInput captures everything a judge LLM needs to score a single
 * RAG turn. The three metric scores live in EvaluationResult.
 *
 * Metric definitions (all 0–1, higher is better):
 *   faithfulness    – Is the answer fully grounded in the provided context?
 *                     Low = hallucinated facts not present in context.
 *   answer_relevance – Does the answer actually address the user's question?
 *                      Low = answer is off-topic or too vague.
 *   context_recall  – Did the retrieved documents contain the info needed to
 *                      answer the question? Low = retrieval missed key facts.
